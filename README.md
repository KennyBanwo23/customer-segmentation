# customer-segmentation
The company, a prominent automobile manufacturer, has been experiencing a 
significant decline in sales within the young professional segment, impacting overall revenue. 
Research indicates that a lack of personalized customer experiences and the absence of tailored 
after-sales services are major factors driving the decline in this segment. The projectâ€™s goal is to 
conduct customer segmentation analysis to identify key customer groups, predict future 
purchasing behaviours, and devise personalized customer experiences to improve customer 
engagement and retention rates.
